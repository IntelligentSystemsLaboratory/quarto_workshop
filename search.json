    "text": "The Quarto publication system is a versatile and powerful tool designed for creating dynamic documents, presentations, websites, and more. It seamlessly integrates text, code, and outputs, making it an ideal choice for data scientists, researchers, and educators who need to combine narrative with analysis. Quarto supports a wide range of programming languages, including R, Python, and Julia, allowing users to embed live code within their documents. Its flexibility extends to output formats as well, enabling the production of HTML, PDF, Word documents, and more, all from a single source file. By leveraging Markdown and advanced features such as citations and cross-referencing, Quarto facilitates the creation of professional and reproducible documents that cater to diverse audiences and purposes.\nJoin us for this hands-on introductory tutorial to the Quarto publishing system. You will learn how to use Quarto to set up a personal academic website, advertise your work, build a blogging environment, as well as create slides, pdf’s or other online materials. At the end of the session you will have the main structure for your personal website, hosted for free in GitHub and with a simple and automatic deployment workflow using GitHub actions. We will provide use case examples and a step-by-step guide to follow along the session.\n\nAgenda\n\n2:15 Introduction to Quarto\n2:25 Get Started\nHands-on\n\n3:00 Listings\n3:30 Templates and Customization\n4:00 Programing",

You collect (1) material to publish in your website data, figures, analyses, and results, those resources are put together with (2) an Integrated Development Environment like Visual Studio creating (3) an organised hierarchy of files and text that includes formatting information, then using (4) a formatting tool like Jekyll all the artefacts are combined into (5) a website of html and other files that can be (6) hosted in a web server.",

    "text": "Integrated Development Environments\nThe separation of the source code and the publishable outputs is something that all Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) provide. These are tools for writing computer programs that commonly require a compilation phase which is usually integrated in the same tool. The idea of authoring tools that can create generic input artefacts that are later combined by a formatting tool is very similar to the common process followed in programming compiled programming languages. This has facilitate the adoption of IDEs as authoring tools. Microsoft Visual Studio and Posit Workbench (formerly RStudio) have tools to work with the Quarto environment. Both of them provide options for collaborative and contemporaneous editing.",
