## Get Started

- Terminal + VS Code

## Get Started

- Run the command 'quarto create project website <mysite>'

- Automatically Quarto will create the following directory structure:
    - _quarto.yml
    - index.qmd
    - about.qmd
    - styles.css

## Get Started

- .yml files
    - YAML is a human-readable data serialization language
    - YAML is an official strict superset of JSON despite looking very different from JSON.
    - To create a YAML file, use either the .yaml or .yml file extension.

- .qmd files
    - Work as markdown files, but they have a configuration section in yml on the top of the file

## Get Started

- _quarto.yml
    - Defines the basic structure of the website.
    - All configurations are done using yml
    - Some of the configurations:
        - Navigation bar
        - Side bar
        - Contents 

## Listings

- Listings enable you to automatically generate the contents of a page (or region of a page) from a list of Quarto documents or other custom data

- Useful to create blogs, newletters
